<h3><a name="Extra_credit_survey"></a><a name="Extra_credit_survey_"></a> Extra-credit survey! </h3>
<p />
We are collaborating with Pomona Unified school district to bring CS to their elementary and middle-school curriculum. To that end, we're asking Pomona Unified middle-school students a few affective questions about their CS experiences.
<p />
It would help the project significantly if you would be willing to take the survey, as well, as college-level CS is the point of traditional first exposure to the field. <i><b>Warning</b></i> The survey is written for an elementary/middle school audience (not by us, by folks who specialize in educational assessment), so it's very basic -- please set aside the level at which it's pitched!
<p />
So, for +10 points of extra credit, we invite you to take the SurveyMonkey survey at
<p />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7GCHGTZ" target="_top">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7GCHGTZ</a>
<p />
Then, under hw 13, simply input the line <b>I took the survey</b> in the initial problem, named <tt>survey.txt</tt>.
<p />
That's it!  &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Thank you!</b>
<p />

<p>
The <b><i>milestone</i></b> is due as part of <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/twiki/bin/view/CS5/Homework12Gold" target="_top">hw12</a> </p><ul>
<li> The milestone is due Tuesday, Dec. 8th
</li> <li> Unfortunately, we won't be able to get those graded until <em>after</em> the final version is due
</li> <li> Its most important goal is to make sure you've gotten a start!
</li></ul>
<p>
The <b><i>final project</i></b> is due <font color="darkred"><b>Friday. Dec. 11th at 8pm</b></font>. </p><ul>
<li> you may use a Euro (if one of the team members has one left)
</li> <li> we will hold lab sessions in December (but for final-project help - there's no sign-in)
</li> <li> we will try to continue tutoring hours through Friday Dec. 11th
</li></ul>
<p>
To submit your final project, create a zipfile named </p><ul>
<li> <tt>vpython_final.zip</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp; or
</li> <li> <tt>textid_final.zip</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp; or

</p><h3><a name="Overview"></a> Overview </h3>
<p>
In the last two weeks of the semester, you will be working on a final course project.  The project is larger in scope than a regular assignment and so is worth 150 points. There are two deliverables:
</p><p> </p><ul>
<li> <b>Milestone</b>: a zip file with a project-specific name containing your intermediate milestone is worth 50 points. This is due along with Hw #12, on <b><font color="green">Tues., Dec. 8th.</font></b> See below for detailed guidelines...
</li></ul>
<p> </p><ul>
<li> <b>Final</b>: a zip file with everything needed to run your final project and named according to your project. This final project submission is worth 100 points (beyond the milestone).  This final project is due on <b><font color="darkred">Friday., Dec. 11th by 8pm</font></b>.  If you (or one of a pair) have a Euro, you're welcome to use that (though tutoring may be somewhat limited on Sat. 12/12.)
</li></ul>
<p>

<p>
</p><h5><a name="Milestone_requirements_for_the_t"></a> <font color="darkred">Milestone requirements</font> for the <tt>textid</tt> project </h5>
<p>
<b>Milestone methods</b>: </p><ul>
<li> <tt>readTextFromFile(self, filename)</tt>: should take in a filename (a string)       and should return all of the text in that file as a single, very large string
</li> <li> <tt>makeSentenceLengths(self, s)</tt>: should use the text in the input string <tt>s</tt> to create          the <tt>self.sentencelengths</tt> dictionary
</li> <li> <tt>printAllDictionaries(self)</tt>: should print out all five of <tt>self</tt>'s dictionaries in full - for testing and checking how they are working...
</li> <li> <tt>cleanString(self,s)</tt>: should take in a string <tt>s</tt> and return a string with no punctuation and no upper-case letters
</li> <li> <tt>makeWordLengths(self, s)</tt>: should use the text in the input string <tt>s</tt> to create          the <tt>self.wordlengths</tt> dictionary
</li> <li> <tt>makeWords(self, s)</tt>: should use the text in the input string <tt>s</tt> to create          the <tt>self.words</tt> dictionary
</li> <li> <tt>makeStems(self, s)</tt>: should use the text in the input string <tt>s</tt> to create          the <tt>self.stems</tt> dictionary
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
You don't yet need to have written <tt>compareTextWithTwoModels(self, model1, model2)</tt> or run your experiments (on at least two models and at least two other texts) -- but if you have, all the better!
</p><p>
Be sure to zip up the folder containing your Text ID project file (or files) and name it <tt>textid_milestone.zip</tt> -- then submit that in the right spot within hw#12!
</p><p>
<br>
</p><p>
</p><h5><a name="Milestone_requirements_for_the_P"></a> <font color="darkred">Milestone requirements</font> for the Picobot project </h5>
<p>
For the milestone, you should submit a version in which you have a working Picobot simulator. The genetic-programming part of the project does <i>not</i> yet
need to work, though we ask that you do have a random-program generator. Here are a the details:  </p><ul>
<li> Your milestone should have a <tt>Program</tt> class with a working constructor and <tt>__repr__</tt> and the method
</li> <li> <tt>randomize</tt> should run correctly. Also,
</li> <li> you should have a <tt>World</tt> class with a working constructor and <tt>__repr__</tt>. Within it,
</li> <li> the <tt>step</tt> and <tt>run</tt> methods should both work correctly...
</li> <li> The genetic algorithm part of the project need not be complete for the milestone -- but if it is, all the better!
</li></ul>
<p>
Be sure to zip up the folder containing your Picobot project file (or files) and name it <tt>picobot_milestone.zip</tt> -- then submit that in the right spot in Hw#12!
</p><p>
<br>
</p><p>
</p><h5><a name="Milestone_requirements_for_the_v"></a> <font color="darkred">Milestone requirements</font> for the vPython project </h5>
<p>
For the milestone, you should submit a version for which the following pieces are implemented and work: </p><ul>
<li> A text document called <code>milestone.txt</code> with your name and the name of your partner (if any), the project that you've chosen, and a brief description of your plans for your game. One paragraph will suffice for the description. Also, include a description of the objective of the game - <i><b>and how we should run it!</b></i>
</li> <li> In addition, your document should give instructions for playing the game as it currently operates, e.g. "Pressing the "s" key will do one thing, the mouse will allow the user to do another thing, etc."
</li> <li> Implementation of enough of the functions, with docstrings, that the game does <i>something interesting</i> (even if it is far short of the complete implementation) in a file called <code>milestone.py</code> -- in fact, if your file is named something else, this is completely OK -- just note how we should run it in your <tt>milestone.txt</tt> file.
</li> <li> Specifically, your program should include at least some "linear" collisions (a point object with a plane or a line) and at least some "spherical" collisions (a point object with another point object)
</li> <li> Include any other files needed to test your game, as well... all of these should be zipped into <tt>vpython_milestone.zip</tt> and submitted.
</li></ul>
<p>
Do be sure to zip up the folder containing your vPython project file (or files) and name it <tt>vpython_milestone.zip</tt> -- then submit that in the right spot in Hw#12!
</p><p>
<br>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<br>
</p><p>
</p><h4><a name="General_Notes"></a> General Notes </h4>
<p> </p><ul>
<li> You may work on the project <em>individually or as a pair</em>.  We especially encourage pairs on large projects like this one, but with a reminder that pairs must work together (physically in the same place) and need to share the workload evenly. In other words, the two people cannot split the work and work individually on their respective parts.  When at the computer, the two people should periodically switch who is sitting at the keyboard.
</li></ul>
<p>
<br><br>
</p><p>
</p><h3><a name="Designing_Implementing_and_Testi"></a> Designing, Implementing, and Testing the Final Project </h3>
<p>
Some notes about the design, implementation and testing of your code: </p><ul>
<li>  Design your code carefully.
</li> <li>  <i><b>Test your code with every change you make.</b></i> <ul>
<li> If there is only one take-away from CS5's software components, this should be it!
</li> <li> Making a large number of changes and then trying to test will leave too many places where things could be going wrong...
</li></ul>
</li> <li>  Please be sure that you provide a docstring for <em>every</em> function and method that you write.
</li> <li>  Where your code is at all complex, provide some additional comments in the code to explain what's happening.
</li> <li>  Use descriptive variable names.
</li> <li>  Avoid magic values!
</li> <li>  Test each function that you write before continuing to write the next function.
</li> <li>  Test your entire program thoroughly.
</li></ul>
